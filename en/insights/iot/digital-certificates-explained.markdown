# Digital Certificates: Your IoT Device's Passport

Before reading this, understand [Public Keys](/en/insights/iot/public-private-keys-explained/) and [Digital Signatures](/en/insights/iot/digital-signatures-explained/).

A digital certificate is like a **passport for your IoT device** — it proves identity and contains your public key. But unlike a passport, it's mathematically impossible to forge.

---

## What's Inside a Certificate?

Think of a certificate as a **signed form** containing:

```
CERTIFICATE CONTENTS:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Device Name: "ESP32-LivingRoom-001" │
│ Public Key: 04 1a 2b 3c 4d...       │
│ Valid From: 2025-01-01              │
│ Valid Until: 2026-01-01             │  
│ Issuer: AWS IoT CA                  │
│ Serial Number: 1234567890ABCDEF     │
│                                     │
│ --- SIGNATURE BY AWS ---            │
│ 30 45 02 20 1a 2b 3c...            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**AWS's signature on the bottom proves:** *"Yes, this device is who they claim to be."*

## Real Certificate Example (PEM format)

```pem
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDdTCCAl2gAwIBAgIJAK1234567890MA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMIGGMQswCQYD
VQQGEwJVUzELMAkGA1UECAwCV0ExEDAOBgNVBAcMB1NlYXR0bGUxEzARBgNVBAoM
CkFtYXpvbi5jb20xHDAaBgNVBAsME0FtYXpvbiBXZWIgU2VydmljZXMxJTAjBgNV
BAMMHEFXUyBJb1QgRGV2aWNlIENlcnRpZmljYXRlMB4XDTI1MDEwMTAwMDAwMFoX
...
[Many more lines of Base64 encoded data]
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

This Base64 blob contains **all the passport information** in a standardized format called **X.509**.

---

## Certificate Formats You'll See

### **PEM Format** (ASCII, human-readable)
```bash
device_certificate.pem     # Your device's cert
ca_certificate.pem         # AWS root certificate
certificate_chain.pem     # Full chain of trust
```

### **DER Format** (Binary, compact)  
```bash
device_certificate.der     # Same content, binary format
ca_certificate.der         # Smaller file size
```

### **In ESP32 Memory**
```c
// How certificates look in code
const char* device_cert = 
"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n"
"MIIDdTCCAl2gAwIBAgIJAK123...\n"
"-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n";

// Or loaded from SPIFFS
esp_err_t load_certificate() {
    return load_pem_file("/spiffs/device_certificate.pem");
}
```

---

## X.509 Structure Decoded

**X.509** is the standard format. Here's what each field means:

```
Version: v3 (modern certificates)
Serial Number: Unique ID for this certificate
Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption or ecdsa-with-SHA256
Issuer: CN=AWS IoT CA, O=Amazon.com, C=US
Validity: 
    Not Before: Jan  1 00:00:00 2025 GMT
    Not After:  Jan  1 00:00:00 2026 GMT
Subject: CN=ESP32-LivingRoom-001, O=CongruentTech
Public Key: ECC P-256 (65 bytes)
Extensions:
    Key Usage: Digital Signature, Key Agreement
    Extended Key Usage: TLS Web Client Authentication
```

---

## How to Read Certificates (OpenSSL Commands)

```bash
# View certificate details
openssl x509 -in device_certificate.pem -text -noout

# Extract public key
openssl x509 -in device_certificate.pem -pubkey -noout

# Check expiration
openssl x509 -in device_certificate.pem -dates -noout

# Verify certificate chain
openssl verify -CAfile aws_root_ca.pem device_certificate.pem
```

## Certificate Authority (CA) Hierarchy

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Root CA<br/>Amazon Root CA 1] --> B[Intermediate CA<br/>AWS IoT CA]
    B --> C[Device Certificate<br/>ESP32-LivingRoom-001]
    B --> D[Device Certificate<br/>ESP32-Kitchen-002]  
    B --> E[Device Certificate<br/>ESP32-Bedroom-003]
```

**Chain of Trust:**
1. **Root CA** = The ultimate authority (Amazon)
2. **Intermediate CA** = Department authority (AWS IoT)  
3. **Device Certificate** = Your device's identity

---

## Certificate Extensions (The Special Permissions)

Like endorsements on your driver's license:

```
Key Usage:
    Digital Signature     ✅  Can sign messages
    Key Encipherment      ✅  Can receive encrypted data
    Certificate Signing   ❌  Cannot issue certificates
    
Extended Key Usage:
    TLS Client Auth       ✅  Can connect as MQTT client
    Code Signing          ❌  Cannot sign firmware
```

---

## Certificate Lifecycle

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Generate CSR] --> B[Submit to CA]
    B --> C[CA Issues Certificate]
    C --> D[Install on Device]
    D --> E[Use for 1 Year]
    E --> F[Renew Before Expiry]
    F --> D
```

**Real ESP32 Lifecycle:**
```c
// Check if certificate expires soon
time_t now = time(NULL);
time_t expiry = certificate_get_expiry();
if ((expiry - now) < (30 * 24 * 3600)) {  // 30 days
    renew_certificate();
}
```

---

## Common Certificate Problems

### **Expired Certificate**
```
Error: certificate verify failed: certificate has expired
```
**Solution:** Renew certificate before expiry

### **Wrong Common Name (CN)**
```  
Error: hostname verification failed
```
**Solution:** Certificate CN must match device identifier

### **Broken Chain**
```
Error: unable to get local issuer certificate
```
**Solution:** Install intermediate CA certificates

### **Clock Sync Issues**
```
Error: certificate is not yet valid
```
**Solution:** Sync device clock with NTP

## File Sizes (Real World)

```
RSA-2048 Certificate: ~1.5KB
ECC P-256 Certificate: ~1.2KB  
CA Certificate Chain: ~3-5KB
Total IoT Certificate Storage: ~4-7KB
```

**ESP32 Flash Layout:**
```
/spiffs/certificates/
├── device_cert.pem        # 1.2KB
├── device_key.pem         # 1.1KB (private key)
├── aws_root_ca.pem        # 1.8KB
└── intermediate_ca.pem    # 1.5KB
                    Total: ~5.6KB
```

## Certificate vs Public Key vs Private Key

| Item | Contains | Purpose | Shareable? |
|------|----------|---------|------------|
| **Private Key** | Your secret number | Decrypt/Sign | ❌ Never |
| **Public Key** | Your public number | Encrypt/Verify | ✅ Yes |
| **Certificate** | Public Key + Identity + CA Signature | Prove ownership | ✅ Yes |

**Certificate = Public Key + Passport Photo + Notary Stamp**

---

## ESP32 Certificate Storage

```c
// PKCS#11 labels for certificate storage
#define DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_LABEL "Device Cert TLS"
#define CA_CERTIFICATE_LABEL     "Root CA Cert"

// Store certificate in secure partition
esp_err_t store_certificate(const char* cert_pem) {
    return pkcs11_store_certificate(
        DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_LABEL,
        (uint8_t*)cert_pem,
        strlen(cert_pem)
    );
}
```
