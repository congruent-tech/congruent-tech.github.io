# Why We Chose `pyenv` for Python Projects

We evaluated popular Python environment tools, their histories, and the core problems they were designed to solve — then made a deliberate choice based on our needs.

---

## What History Taught Us

- **Pre-2007**: Global package installs caused conflicts and breakage.
- **2007**: `virtualenv` introduced isolation to solve this.
- **2012**: Python 3.3+ introduced `venv` — a simpler, built-in version of `virtualenv`.
- **2010s**: `pyenv` came along to solve a deeper problem — managing multiple **Python versions**, not just environments.

##  Why We Didn't Choose `venv` (Despite Being Newer)

- `venv` is simple and built-in, but it **uses the system Python**.
- That means no control over which Python version you're using.
- You can't easily switch between Python 3.7, 3.10, or 3.11 for different projects.
- You also can't install new versions without affecting your global environment.

## Why We Chose `pyenv + venv`

- We wanted **complete isolation** — both for packages *and* for the interpreter itself.
- `pyenv` lets us install and pin any Python version locally per project.
- When combined with `venv`, it gives us a clean, reproducible setup that doesn’t interfere with global tools or other projects.

## Final Word

While `venv` is great for basic isolation, we needed full control and independence.  
That’s why we chose the power combo:  
 **`pyenv` for managing Python versions + `venv` for isolated environments.**
